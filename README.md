# CrazyKnob
This is children's developmental constructor for children from 1 to 100 years old
Initially, I wanted to complement the NeuRobot project
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1378603

But in the end, the project was no longer focused on the robotic part, 
and became a designer quite existing and without separately.  
It understandable to small children. The existing parts base has been reworked and supplemented. 
CrazyKnob is fully compatible with NeuRobot. 
Therefore, you can consider CrazyKnob as an addition to NeuRobot or NeuRobot as an addition to CrazyKnob.
