# CrazyKnobs
This is children's developmental constructor for children from 1 to 100 years old
Initially, I wanted to complement the NeuRobot project
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1378603

But during development, the project was no longer focused on the robotic part.
It understandable to small children. The existing parts base has been reworked and supplemented. 
CrazyKnob is fully compatible with NeuRobot. 
Therefore, you can consider CrazyKnob as an addition to NeuRobot or NeuRobot as an addition to CrazyKnob.

Constructor have next line

1. "Base" - 
This is only constructor. Easy, safety. For understading other part need learn to play with this part. This is element base.

2. "Mechanic" - 
Was added bearings, gears, wheels and other mechanic part.

3. "Robotic" -
This part is similar as NeuRobot. But I try use cheaper Chinese components and more focused on school children than students.

Flexibale component. Printing with flexible plastic. 

5. "ExtendedKit" -
