# Summary

Large bearing for Ciclop 3D Scanner  
I had some trouble in locating the large bearing for the ciclop in as much as I would have look for it on the internet then to leave my house to get it and it would probably cost me money. So I printed one, I figured it would take more than the time in research and effort anyway. It prints nicely but tolerance is close 0.15mm between the balls and race it released cleanly after printing and needs no supports to print. I did the plate as well I printed it in PLA the bed was a warm 50deg so it stuck like crazy I thought i was going to break it taking it off. 1st layer no fan then full fan for the rest
